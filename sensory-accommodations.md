# Sensory accommodations

<why sensory accommodations matter. people don't really know about them. problems with awareness. no gatekeeping!>

## General tips

- Try things out even if you're unsure. You don't hurt anyone with any of these, and you only know if you experience it.
- Consider an 'accomodation satchel'. (I personally use a fanny pack over my body with my sunglasses, loops, sea bands, fan, tissues, and sunscreen.) Having a way to keep these items close to me and consistent at all times helps not only with regulation and comfort, but with anxiety because I know I'll be able to accomodate myself.
- As you try things, let your curiosity explore further. For example, if you find yourself particularly soothed by a weighted blanket, consider more research or attention to your proprioceptive processing.
