# neurodivergent-resources

This is a WIP repository - meant to be a place with resources for neurodivergent people. 

I hope to have things like:
- Terms/definitions
- Accomodation lists (e.g. sensory accomodations, accomodations available in specific scenarios like airports)
- Social guides (social cues explained [?], scripts/outlines for difficult conversations [asking a manager for a change in workload], even describing common social rules in context of culture, like bringing a gift to dinner.) It's very important that these guides would not be saying that someone SHOULD behave in these ways, or portraying anything other than neutrality around masking. Rather, they should offer actual answers to the otherwise evasive social rules, almost like explaining to a visitor from another culture, and they can choose to observe the culture in their own way.
